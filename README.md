#ABOUT TASK PROJECT
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique used to create a new image by combining the content of one image with the style of another. It uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), typically VGG19, to extract and manipulate image features.
How It Works:
Feature Extraction:
A CNN (like VGG19) is used to extract content features from deeper layers and style features from shallower layers.
Loss Functions:
Content Loss: Measures the difference between content image and generated image features.
Style Loss: Measures the difference in style features (using Gram matrices) between style image and generated image.
Total Loss: A weighted combination of content and style losses, minimized using optimization.
Optimization:
A random image is initialized and iteratively updated using gradient descent to minimize the total loss and produce the stylized output.
